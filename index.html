            Hello, I am David Huang. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville who is part of the HEATH Integrated Business and Engineering Program’s cohort of 2023. I am working towards getting my bachelor's in Computer Science in 2023. I also plan on getting a Master's afterward.
    <br><br>
    I am currently a manager at Speed Queen Wash & Dry Laundromat. My responsibilities include the online management of the business’s advertising and online profiles along with being in charge of communications with other business entities such as the landlord, supply companies, etc.

    I have previously been a waiter, host, and cashier at buffets such as the 88 Kitchen, Blue Sky Buffet, and China Buffet. I was able to deal with handling money, orders, the seating of customers, and directly serving customers through tending to their needs.
    <br><br>
    I have also interned with the two start-up companies Ethar, Inc., and Jersey Exchange during the summer of 2020. I gained experience in conducting market research about the customer journey and customer relationship system while also gaining experience as a web developer on the platform of Shopify.
    <br><br>
    I have a strong passion for helping my community using the tools that are at my disposal. As I try and gather more experience and knowledge within Computer Science, I hope to someday be able to use technology in order to tackles problems such as breaking down the language barriers that inhibit individuals from being able to access resources or just go through daily life easily.
